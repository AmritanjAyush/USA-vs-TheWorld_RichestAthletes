# USA vs The World - Forbes Richest Athletes
A Data Visualization mini poster made on RStudio using ggplot to compare Top athletes' pay in the USA vs the world based on Forbes List Dataset

This was a small project done by me to explore the dataset "Forbes Richest Athletes 1990-2020" using RStudio's ggplot2 package. 

**The poster and the code for the graphs has been uploaded to this repo.**
